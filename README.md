# parseptron
A Python implementation of an unlabeled dependency parsing system. Uses
Eisner's dependency parsing algorithm to find the best parse tree for a
sentence given a set of features and their corresponding weights, and uses
the structured perceptron algorithm to learn these feature weights.
